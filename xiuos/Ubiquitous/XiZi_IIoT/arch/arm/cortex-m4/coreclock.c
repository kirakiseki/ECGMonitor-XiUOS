  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M4 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  *
  *   This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
  *   user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f4xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *                                     
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
